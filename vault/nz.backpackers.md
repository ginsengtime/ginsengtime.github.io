! Backpackers?[^1]

Anthony Gardiner for _The Guardian_

* __Stuart Nash__ (minister of tourism): ban renting of vans to "Freedom Campers"
  * unsanitary
  * takes away from economy (sleeping in van instead of campgrounds)
  * "value over volume" â€” but WHERE does money from "high-value" tourists go?
* pre-COVID: ~70,000 working visa visitors; ~75,000 on student visas
  * longer stays
  * diverse jobs AND spending
  * "marketing" (omg my trip to new zealand _~changed me~_)
  * visits from family and friends (more spending)
  * future visits for nostalgia
  * _accounted for almost 14% of workforce in 2019_
* Three P's of business sustainability: __People, Planet, Profit__
* Missing data
  * environmental impact of long vs. short-term
  * cultural engagements during stay

! Questions...

  * has mr nash simply. not considered the relative value of each kind of tourist? who's his research team?
  * what spurred this remark? [^2]
  * I also wonder about the numbers that would back up Gardiner's claim. but i also don't rly feel like searching rn klasjlgkaj
  * i do agree them vans be nasty as hell tho. definitely a continuation of the trend of ecological destruction from higher tourism.
