! Backpackers?[^1]

Anthony Gardiner for _The Guardian_

- **Stuart Nash** (minister of tourism): ban renting of vans to "Freedom Campers"
  - unsanitary
  - takes away from economy (sleeping in van instead of campgrounds)
  - "value over volume" — but WHERE does money from "high-value" tourists go?
- pre-COVID: ~70,000 working visa visitors; ~75,000 on student visas
  - longer stays
  - diverse jobs AND spending
  - "marketing" (omg my trip to new zealand _~changed me~_)
  - visits from family and friends (more spending)
  - future visits for nostalgia
  - _accounted for almost 14% of workforce in 2019_
- Three P's of business sustainability: **People, Planet, Profit**
- Missing data

  - environmental impact of long vs. short-term
  - cultural engagements during stay

! Questions...

- has mr nash simply. not considered the relative value of each kind of tourist? who's his research team?
- what spurred this remark? [^2]
- I also wonder about the numbers that would back up Gardiner's claim. but i also don't rly feel like searching rn klasjlgkaj
- i do agree them vans be nasty as hell tho. definitely a continuation of the trend of ecological destruction from higher tourism.
